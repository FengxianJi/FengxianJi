I once naively believed that human agency alone could transcend all things. The vines of nihilism entwine us—not because they are a void, but because they are an inescapable part of reality. May there be a little more tolerance among people, and may there be a little more resilience within the self amidst suffering. One must save oneself rather than wait to be saved, for we are all equally entangled in the vines.
